<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title></title>
    </head>
<!-- Anchor elements are used to create a link by wrapping it with the <a> tag -->
<!-- Adding the href(hyperlink reference) creates the destination of the link -->
    <body>
        <h1>Homepage</h1>
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">click me</a>

        <a href="./pages/about.html">About</a>

<!-- There are two kinds of links we can create,
1. absolute links, links that go to other pages on the internet. 
They use links made up of: protocol://domain/path
2. relative links, they are links within our own website. 
These links do not include the domain name because it is assumed 
they use the same one -->

<!-- pages that are relative must have the proper pathways relative 
    to the page being linked, ex "./pages/about.html" -->
<!-- prepending ./ to the code will tell it to start looking for the file/directory
relative to the current directory -->

<!-- Images can also be linked using the <img> tag, which is, unlike other tags, an empty tag
ex. <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png"> using an src attribute -->
